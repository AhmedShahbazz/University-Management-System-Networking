## Project Overview

This University Management System aims to demonstrate a realistic university network scenario using Cisco Packet Tracer. The simulation includes various departments, host connections, server setups, and internet connectivity. It is an educational tool that helps students and professionals understand and design network infrastructures in educational institutions.

## Features

- **Departmental Networks:** Separate networks for various departments like Engineering, Arts, and Science.
- **Centralized Server System:** A server setup that manages all the data and applications for the university.
- **Internet Connectivity:** Simulation of external internet connectivity and how it is managed and distributed across the campus.
- **Security Features:** Implementation of basic network security protocols to protect data and maintain privacy.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your computer. Download it from the [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) after registering for a free account.

## How to Use

1. **Open Cisco Packet Tracer:** Launch Cisco Packet Tracer on your computer.
2. **Open the Project File:** Navigate to `File > Open`, and select the `.pkt` file from the cloned repository.
3. **Explore the Network:** Use the simulation mode to interact with the network, send packets, and see the network's behavior.
4. **Modify and Test:** Feel free to modify the network setup and test different configurations to see how the network responds.

## Cisco Packet Tracer Setup

Ensure that you are using the latest version of Cisco Packet Tracer to avoid compatibility issues. Set up the initial environment by following the detailed guides available on the [Cisco Networking Academy website](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).
